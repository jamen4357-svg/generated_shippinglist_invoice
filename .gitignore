# Git Ignore File
# ============================================================================
# This file tells Git which files and folders to permanently ignore.
# It prevents them from being accidentally committed to the repository.

# --- Ignore Portable Tool Directories ---
# These folders contain the downloaded Python and Git executables and are
# specific to each user's machine. They should not be part of the repository.
portable-git/
python-embed/

# --- Ignore Python Cache ---
# These folders are created automatically by Python and are not needed.
__pycache__/
*.pyc

# --- Ignore Temporary Files ---
# Optional: Add other files or patterns you want to ignore, like temp files.
# For example, to ignore all .log files:
# *.log


# --- Ignore Data Directories ---
# These contain user data, generated files, and temporary data
# that should not be tracked in version control
data/
result/
temp_uploads/

# --- Python Test Files ---
# Ignore any Python files containing 'test' in the filename
*test*.py

# --- Excel Files ---
# Ignore all .xlsx files
*.xlsx
# But keep the important templates in invoice_gen/TEMPLATE/
!invoice_gen/TEMPLATE/*.xlsx

# --- JSON Files ---
# Ignore all .json files
*.json
# But keep configuration files
!*_config.json
!**/config/*.json
!**/TEMPLATE/*.json

# --- Environment Files ---
